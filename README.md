# 3D-renderer
A basic and lightweight, custom 3D renderer implemented in C using raylib, featuring vector and matrix operations for graphics rendering.

This project is a basic 3D renderer written in C using the Raylib library. The renderer demonstrates fundamental 3D rendering techniques such as matrix transformations, vector operations, and rendering of 3D models. It serves as a learning tool for understanding the basics of computer graphics and 3D rendering pipelines.

## Project Structure
- `main.c`: Primary source code for the renderer
- `matrix.h`: Matrix transformation utilities
- `vector.h`: Vector manipulation header
- `3dModels/`: Directory for 3D model assets
- `build.sh`: Build script for the project

## Prerequisites
- raylib library
- GCC or Clang compiler
- Basic development tools

## Building the Project
```bash
# Make the build script executable
chmod +x build.sh

# Compile the project
./build.sh
```

## Running the Renderer
```bash
# Execute the main program
./main
```
